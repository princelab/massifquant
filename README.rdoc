= massifquant

Uses Kalman tracking to quantify chromatographic peaks in a bin-less manner.  Operates on previously centroided data. 

This repo is a vastly incomplete) ruby rewrite of the original implementation by Christopher Conley (matlab and C/C++) of a work by Aberg et al. ({J Chromatogr A. 2008 May 23;1192(1):139-46}[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18378252]).

The {canonical massifquant implementation}[http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/xcms.html] is in C/C++ and is part of {XCMS}[http://metlin.scripps.edu/xcms/] which is {part of the bioconductor package}[http://www.bioconductor.org/].
